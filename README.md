## Setting up

To create the Python virtual environment, run the following command:

```

## Uploading to Garmin Connect

In the Beurer HealthManager Pro main page, click History, then the kebab menu (`Ó¨ê`), and then Export.
Select the CSV file format, and click Share.

Save the file somewhere accessible to this Python scrip, and then run:

The script will ask you to log in to Garmin Connect if needed. The login will be saved to a dedicated file named after
the user's first name.
